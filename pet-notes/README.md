Pet Notes
Pet Notes is a Sinatra app that lets users add Pet Profiles. Users have the ability to add their pet's name, what type of animal it is, what it eats, how often it is fed, and additional notes. 

The Home Page displays all of the user's Pet Profiles. From here they can create a new Pet Profile, select which pet's Profile they want to individually view, along with edit or delete the Profile.
